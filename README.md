# Simple Neural Network for MNIST data
I made this Jupyter notebook to learn some concepts of Keras.

- Showing the progress of the training in a graph
- Easy configuration of hidden layers
- Normalizing the input data
- Initializing the weights with the Xavier function
- Regularizing the weights with a L2 regularizer
- Plotting accuracy and loss under training

The hyperparameters are optimized for GPU. I installed Anaconda, Cuda9 and Keras on Ubuntu 16.04 to do this experiment.
